			<h1>Welcome in Child Monitoring System</h1>
			<p>
			<h4>Some of the basics function of Child Monitoring System:</h4>
			<h2>1.Location tracking:</h2>
			Our systems include location-tracking technology that allows parents
			to know where their child is at all times. This feature is
			particularly useful for parents of younger children who are not yet
			able to communicate their location or navigate the world
			independently.
			<h2>2.Internet monitoring:</h2>
			With the proliferation of smartphones and other internet-enabled
			devices, child monitoring systems often include features that allow
			parents to monitor their child's online activities, including
			websites visited, social media activity, and messages sent and
			received.
			<h2>3.Contact log:</h2>
			The contact log function in a child monitoring system records and
			tracks all incoming and outgoing communications made by a child on
			their monitored device.This function helps parents or caregivers keep
			track of who their child is communicating with, when the
			communication occurred, and the content of the communication. The
			contact log can be useful in identifying potential risks to the
			child's safety and can also be used to monitor and limit the child's
			communication with certain individuals or groups.
