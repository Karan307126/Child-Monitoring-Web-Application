CMS - CHILD MONITORING SYSTEM . 
This is Child Monitoring System made using Html , Css , Js as FrontEnd and also  used JSP . And Connected To Database Mysql using JDBC Driver . I used Servlet In This Project .  This Project Uses Current Location of Child and insert into database . This Location Only Viewed by access given Parents Only . Also I added Browsing History Function that insert all browsing history of child's device and insert into database and same as location it viewed by only accessed parents only . So by using this web app parents can track thier child's location and also web history .   
This Web Application run on the background of child's device constantly gives device's location and web browsing to parents when parents wans to track or monitor . 
it uses database as mysql for storing child's location coordinates at that time and also web url and title at that time . so parents can track their child by monitoring this informantion.
